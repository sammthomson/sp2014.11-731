trade union , representing hundreds of employees staff schools , who lost seats in last month , plans to sue the city on wednesday , arguing that the layoffs were not needed and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence on the school , where learn poor students .
six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other officials , who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , manageable groups workers , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council in last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт that layoffs were part of the budget , he said , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 reported that they approached with the notice claims , the department of education , warning that against him filed ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce the formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesman for the city 's legal department , said that the city is not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its concrete provisions .
he points out that , while the статен - island layoffs was not , but schools in upper east side or трибеки their was little , 17 ancillary workers schools lost seats in the district 23 in браунсвилле , brooklyn , and 46 in the south bronx , was forced to resign in the districts 8 and 9 .
p.s. budget 36th was scrapped on 3,26 percent this year , and she also lost money , when the city has changed the way of counting the additional funding on each poor student , who is enrolled in school .
in the notification used the word " excess " , although about " excessive " more often , when a teacher from payroll schools moves in the list of available workers , wages , which pays for the central office .
all that , it took , is to the rebellion failed , a longtime dictator muammar qaddafi was captured and killed , and the american intervention resulted .
" sense of this resolution to commend the honors отважному to the people of libya , when they are starting to rebuild their country , " said kerry .

but , in the same day , when the bill failed in the house of representatives , the house also has not supported the proposal which would cut funding for american operations in libya .
resolution of the foreign affairs committee at the " admires the people of libya for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanks the men and women of the armed forces of the united states , and their coalition partners , who participated in the military operation to protect the libyan people for their formidable courage and professionalism . "
whether the new measures will receive full support of the council of foreign affairs or a расколют legislators , as the june draft law ?
люгера spokesman , said monday , that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill .
this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives bob гудлатом ( republican , virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or than any other , which will be on the plenary vote this congress convening .
amendment гудлата - only one of 68 , constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this convening .
there are at least 15 versions of the amendments on a balanced budget only in the house of representatives and even how much something about " control of federal spending . "
budget control act , which passed in august , and demanded that the house of representatives , and the senate voted for an amendment about a balanced budget .
in addition to the budget , some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of authority of the members of congress , and a member of the house of representatives , jose serrano ( democrat , new york ) wants to abolish the restriction in two terms for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages already offer for many years , and as another , effectively banning flag burning .
as neither aspired to members of congress to propose amendments , they are not faster , than in years past .
this rate pales compared to the beginning of the early 1990s , when the members of congress , according to the library , the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments to every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , 27 - i - was approved in 1992 , but listed in the congress , she actually was in the 1789 .
after ten months after an armed man shot in her emphasis on a public event in tucson , a member of the house of representatives of the democratic party , gabrielle giffords ( ariz. ) on monday evening , appeared on the federal canal , подпела melody from бродвейского show " the sun will return tomorrow and said , " that wants to get better , more than to return to congress .
program showed its bumpy recovery after the injury inflicted by a bullet , which раздробила skull and пробила left side of the brain , passing from front to rear of the head .
in his first televised interview after the january shooting , in which six were killed and wounded 13 people , giffords smiled , laughed and sang - and named its recovery " difficult " .
an interview with giffords and her husband , astronaut mark kelly , was part of the hour " 20/20 " special issue , " which was broadcast on the eve of the withdrawal of the new book " гэбби spouses : the story of courage and hope . "
on the video , decommissioned kelly in the first few weeks , she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on forehead .
a few months later , we see as giffords sitting there in the stroller , and physiotherapists teach her , how to perform simple actions .

completely opposite impression illustrate the uneasy relationship that developed between the army and often indifferent , and sometimes восхищенной american audience .
" we are not necessarily victims " , " said brigadier general sean b. mcfarland , who commanded the troops in iraq , and soon went into afghanistan .
this is a very sensitive topic for military commanders , which do not want to look ungrateful or objecting with the society , which they serve .
as a result , most conversations about the pity is occurring quietly and only among the combat veterans .
some will be to look at them with admiration , because they are sacking the rebels , and there were in exotic places .
while looking for work , he says , he felt that some of the interviewers cautiously asked whether he will be able to withstand the strain responsible work in the washington immediately after the combat tour .
awkwardness , which are experiencing the military , partially comes from the u.s. indifference to wars .
" we , as a nation , no longer appreciate military heroism so , as it was quite usual in world war ii , " said lieutenant - general in the resignation of david бэрноу , who commanded american forces in afghanistan .

burke says she choses at higher echelons of the army , because what the problem starts with them .
" who those people , that can exterminate cult of violence ? higher leadership " .
her strategy : instead , to collect all of the plaintiffs in this case is putting all your eggs in one basket , so to say , " she will open a lot of cases , if necessary , to maintain the pressure .
court documents , which received a newsweek , reveal a strategy - basically a protection that former or current soldiers cannot claims to the army for damage sustained in the armed forces .
" alleged damages belongs to the risk , присущему military service of the plaintiffs , " says in the documents .
and in iraq , and in afghanistan , the women 's team - soldiers play an increasingly important role , especially in the contacts with local women in the fighting zone .
in the yale law school seminar legal service veterans is preparing the case against four of the largest military academies on charges in encouraging женоненавистнической atmosphere .

she collected evidence of the rape kit , and blood assailant - from cutting on the hand - was found on her bed .
six man gave positive description of indictees , who was eventually acquitted .
" i thought , that i am now a - i ran out of the courtroom , with shouting . "
lyman was ordered to refer to the military psychiatrist , who eventually diagnosed her change of personality , that made her intolerable to service .
продвинется whether forward the case , by the lyman and her comrades on the suit , is a complicated question , " says john turley , professor of law in the name george washington university school of law .
between them and the verdict stands the doctrine , which criticized since , how she appeared .
army lagged in the decades , because she had no those incentives and impeding the funds , which imposes responsibility .
these things are will change only to then , when decent people would be willing to fight .
" we will continue to fight the army on the issue , until will not be reforms " , " she says .

facebook also constantly extracts all kinds of the data about their own users .
but facebook users know that the site watching them , like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play in the скраббл with friend , in thousands of miles away from you , the site can handle your personal data .
while researchers have a strictly certain norms of conduct offline - research data , online publicity .

nearly 30 survivors and the relatives of of the victims of the attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but , personally , i become a little bit easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea about what he is part of a large " resistance " movement , a judge ruled that he is not mad , and said that there is no evidence , that he acted with accomplices .
but it is not reduces the grief and confusion , which is now automatically feels the whole nation .

minister of defense leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and cause financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan , on the line and to civil assembly .

" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the trust of those , who supports our army and will do serious damage combat readiness " .
" although the military funding in overseas contingency operations not affected directly секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "

whether the recent warnings senators or a letter to panetta will lead to budget a compromise or strengthen calls for release of the pentagon from cuts , will see later .
at a press conference last week , defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what may follow the further -- troops with a shell , but without the kernel .
" this is a paper tiger , the army with the barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in his introductory comments in the pentagon .

a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how much are serious and повсеместны deception and lies in the everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged with in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they are allegedly hide that retired football coach raped boys .

history about the fraud on the exams in the school and college - standard thing .
mentors , which should teach the opposite , send the message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
during the one day , as studies show that , you can lie from 10 before 200 times .
another study showed that people unfamiliar солгали three times for the first 10 minutes with each other dating .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
not worth it from doing this conclusion , that liars hard notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interview , negotiation or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie , which they say , most often наглая . )
observe behind the asphyxia , the laughter , voice characteristics in your facility .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the doors , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely .
somebody can use the " qualification language " , when responds to a difficult question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical funds , to expose the lie , but to master the skill detection of deception can be .

in his lectures technological view of the pits , read within the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both with high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said specialist in the field of chemical engineering .
among the most of the upper layers is bitumen , compiled by the small stones , опущенных in the bitumen and then the спрессованных .
while moving vehicles , and latch effort , this helps forces very well be distributed on the road to cover .
at асфальтовом cover , he added , placed last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and it is necessary to take into account material , from whom he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all strata of the cover , and therefore education yam .

if there is a theme , the decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion , or under the influence of emotion , so it 's energy policy .
it is a healthy trend , that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear power .
france must to build its opinion data on objective facts and , on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of mineral resources , to continue electricity production continuously , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which had disappeared from the environmental debate .
here 's why germany remains alone in their decision to abandon the nuclear - energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - here is the only a few of those who strongly continues to their projects .
although the model germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes in as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
price , which the majority of the french refuse to pay more because , they do not oppose this kind of energy , in principle .

security in france , we have the authority , which operates edged and a transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .

then was administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french of the economy and immigration for the french of society .
in his program of francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " a joint work will solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов complementarity , existing between local and immigrants , leads that the arrival of the immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among the american nobel laureates large share of naturalized immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all based on immigrants ) .
according to the organization of labour , for example , in germany , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) on average , 150 000 euros .
mentioned teeth , which used , to scare immigrants , they gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is this valuable acquisition ; but it simultaneously and a fragile .
some believed that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , that we are experiencing , " this economic crisis , but first and foremost , this is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , requiring a series of national referendums , organized as necessary and in хаотическом manner .
there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the whole of europe entirely subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffers from his weakness , and from the lack of solidarity .
many worried about the transfer of sovereignty , europe , but the entire europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with her each of her nations together .
because only joint work of europeans will be able to reduce the severity of the debt each , free from markets and prepare for the future , by investing in him .
after a long discussion this proposal the socialists and jacques delors all now , require the european economic government .
but to represent her without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is regular madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , was necessary to " to create a " the republicans .
it can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , the present popular european sovereignty .

analysis occurred calls pointed out at several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but , no doubt , we must wait for the more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between the aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , it is known , that sect идейную and receives financial support from outside and that she is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigerian researcher .
the international community , headed by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the problem , which creates the boko haram .
she aims mainly in on the of the church , and bars and the authorities .
in the past christmas , she took on responsibility for the diluted share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another for one in abuja .
in the august local representation in the organization of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent .

mitt romney , who has the best chances of the nomination from the " good old party " , has threatened to sue the chinese complaint with the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration for their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former president obama 's ambassador in china and the only candidate , the complicated foreign policy , could not overcome position , that appeasing emotions .
but huntsman , who rests in the lower parts of the ratings , remained неуслышанным .
romney , also promised to military strikes against iran , if the sanctions will not be able to stop its nuclear program .

funding to build gas pipeline was secured on the 30 % of shareholders and the 70 % of the banking credit .
gas pipeline emerges from the baltic sea is in lubmin on a sandy shore , mulberry , coniferous trees .
